## Introduction

In this directory, I try to implement the algorithm of XGBoost.

## CheckList

- [x] regularized learning objective
- [x] gradient tree boosting
- [ ] shrinkage
- [ ] column subsampling
- [x] basic exact greedy algorithm
- [x] approximate local
- [ ] approximate global
- [x] weighted quantile sketch
- [x] spatity-aware algorithm
- [x] column block
- [x] cache-aware acess
- [ ] blocks for out-of-core computation
- [ ] distributed computing
